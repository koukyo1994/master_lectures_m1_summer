\section{What I want to obtain from this class.}
Before writing about my motivation, I need to introduce myself briefly.I am a first grade student of Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics.I'm in Hori/Yairi lab, which is sometimes called Artificial Intelligence Laboratory because we are researching 
the methodology to handle complex data and independent systems. \\

The teaching style of Prof. Hori and Prof. Yairi is consistent, they give us complete freedom so that we can freely foster our imagination
 to achive a great research.This policy of theirs is good in one side but it also has a problem in another side.Complete freedom means that 
we can select any theme for our master research, but it also means that we must conduct research with almost no support of the laboratory.We must
 find a problem, conduct research on it, and provide solution only by ourselves. \\
 
What I expect for this class is deep, broad insight obtained by a wide field of view.I cannot know what is the problem in the society unless
 I have a broad perspective.What can be done as my research may sometimes come out from others, especially from those who has completely different
 background.If selected, I'm going to make full use of the opportuinity to spread my insight, to know the world, and to discuss with excellent MIT
 students.\\
 

 
\section{What I can do to make this class attractive for MIT students.}
I'm majoring in aeronautics and astronautics.Aerospace engineering is a field to study methodology that constitutes a system that operates in
an extreme environment by fusing various fields.That means, that we are expertized on multiple engineering fields.We can provide a specialized
 viewpoint on various fields and that may help MIT students, I think.\\
 
From another point of view, I can help MIT students know a very Japanese thing.I have practiced two marshal arts.One is Aikido, which is now very
 popular worldwide.I also practiced one of extreme marshal arts called Taido.Taido is one of less-known marshal arts, but I'm convinced that
 they will be attracted to the dynamic and cool techniques of Taido.I am actually one of the athletes who participated in the world championship of
 Taido held last year, so I can tell them how it is like to be the forefront of the world in one field.
