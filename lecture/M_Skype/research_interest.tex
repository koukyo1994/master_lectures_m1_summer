\section{What I did for Bachelor thesis}
I did research on the interaction of drone and ground rover, especially on the interaction of tethered drone and ground rover.\\

Tethered drone is not a popular things as ordinally drones, so I'm going to introduce it.
Tethered drone is literaly a drone attached with a tether.Usually the other end of the tether is attached to somewhere on the ground or
something like a ground rover. \\

Whether the teteher is taut or slack is important.I worked on the taut case.Because of the tether, the dynamics of the drone is affected by the 
force from the tether and the dynamics of drone becomes difficult to control.\\

I tried to make a good control law to handle tethered drone but failed in my bachelor thesis.\\

In Master course, I'm interested in the interaction of drones.I'm not sure what is the exact thing I'd like to do, but recently I'm planning to 
conduct multi agent simulation about that.
